# What is a Memo?
Memos are internal documents containing information that is part of the organizationâ€™s knowledge. These can be:
-	Ideas for how to approach a problem
-	Results of experiments or prototypes
-	Thoughts about areas to explore

The idea is to capture information in a searchable system, instead of transmitting them via email where there is not a common searchable repository.

## State Machine
Each memo can have one or more versions.  A version starts as a draft, moves to signoff when it is submitted, then to active when it is signed off (or has no signatures) and finally becomes obsolete when
1. Another version of the memo becomes active
2. The user, the delegate of the user or the admin marks the memo as obsolete

A memo can be in one of 4 states, Draft, Signoff, Active or Obsolete.
