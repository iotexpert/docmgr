# What is a Memo?

## State Machine
Each memo can have one or more versions.  A version starts as a draft, moves to signoff when it is submitted, then to active when it is signed off (or has no signatures) and finally becomes obsolete when
1. Another version of the memo becomes active
2. The user, the delgate of the user or the admin marks the memo as obsolete
A memo can be in one of 4 states, Draft, Signoff, Active or Obsolete.
### Draft

## Title
## Distribution
A list of **Usernames** seperated by space,comma,semicolon,colon or tab.  AKA the Python regular expression '\s|\,|\t|\;|\:'
## Keywords
A freeform list of words seperated by space,comma,semicolon,colon or tab.  AKA the Python regular expression '\s|\,|\t|\;|\:'.  I contemplated making this a curated list (i.e. by the administrator) but in my expereince this list would never be up to date and would fall into disuse.  I also contemplated making the system capable to adding a "department" but once again decided that a keyword was more generic. 

The only use of keywords in the system are 

An example list of keywords "quality, engineering, design".
